What are the different ways the program can end?
================================================

The program ends when it at some point calls the label <exit@plt>. This is done from three different labels, and thus the program can end in three different ways:

    - By falling of the edge of the earth and dying. Label: <edge_of_the_earth>
    - By winning the game. Label: <win>
    - By finding the secret win. Label: <secret_win>

The label <secret_win> however when executed also allows the user to submit a password to hear a joke, thus this is actually two different endnings, one where you get the joke and one where you do not.


How do you get it to end in each way?
